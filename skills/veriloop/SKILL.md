  Review concrete recent code changes before commit, merge, or deployment: a diff,
  uncommitted work, branch, PR, or just-finished feature written by a user, coding
  agent, IDE assistant, subagent, or automated task. Trigger on review, check, verify,
  inspect, final pass, 검토, 리뷰, 확인, or 훑어보기, including requests focused only on
  regression, performance, metered-service cloud cost, readability, or repository
  conventions. Ground the review in a confirmed written specification; when none
  exists, route to the bundled draft-spec skill before reviewing. Use when the user
  invokes $veriloop or requests Veriloop review. Do not use for
  reviewing documents or designs, applying existing findings, writing review-process
  guidance, or discussing review culture.

# Veriloop

Review a diff the way a careful senior engineer reviews a teammate's PR — except the
teammate is an AI agent, which changes what you should be suspicious of. Agents write
plausible-looking code fast, but they tend to make a specific family of mistakes:

- They change a function without checking every caller.
- They write queries that work but scan far more data than needed — which on metered
  cloud services (Cosmos DB RUs, DynamoDB RCUs, per-call APIs) is a *billing* bug, not
  just a performance one.
- They invent their own style instead of matching the repository's existing patterns.
- They over-engineer: extra abstraction layers, dead configuration, speculative options.

Your job is to catch these before the change lands. Work through the five passes below
in order. Report only what you have verified against the actual code — a review full of
speculative findings trains the reader to ignore it.

## Blind invocation contract

When `run-review-loop` invokes this skill in strict blind mode, treat the review as an
isolated evaluation:

- Accept only the strict-blind invocation marker, repository path, frozen review
  target, confirmed specification, scope bounds, and risk focus.
- Do not accept or request the developer's reasoning, fixer explanation, prior review
  reports, findings ledger, acceptance-check results, or gate probes.
- Do not read `.agent-review/`, including its baseline, ledger, or run archives.
- Inspect the code and specification independently. Do not infer what another reviewer
  already checked.

This is context isolation, not a filesystem security boundary. If the invocation
contains forbidden history, stop and ask the controller for a clean brief instead of
continuing with contaminated context. Standalone reviews may use prior review state
only when the user explicitly asks for a follow-up review.

## Step 0 — Specification gate

A diff can only be judged against its intended behavior, and intent lives in a written
specification — a requirements/design document, an ADR, a ticket with concrete
acceptance detail, an API contract. Establish it before touching the code:

- Identify the spec this change implements: the document the user, branch, PR, or
  ticket references, the goal contract of a running `run-review-loop`, or a doc the user
  points you to when asked.
- Read it and carry it through every pass: the regression pass checks the change
  against what the spec promises, and the verdict answers "does this do what the spec
  says" — not merely "does this look clean".
- **If no specification exists, do not run the review.** A review without a spec can
  only judge taste, not correctness. Say that plainly and switch to the bundled
  `draft-spec` skill: it analyzes the codebase (house rules, conventions, workflow)
  and the change itself, then drafts the spec for the user to correct and confirm.
  Run the review only once the confirmed spec exists.

## Step 1 — Scope the diff

Determine exactly what changed. Resolve the target in this order (stop at the first that
applies):

1. The user pointed at something specific (a PR number, commit range, branch, or paths)
   — review that.
2. There are uncommitted changes (`git status`, `git diff HEAD`) — review the working
   tree against HEAD.
3. Otherwise review the current branch against its merge base with the default branch
   (`git merge-base HEAD <default-branch>`).

Collect the full diff and the list of changed files. Read every changed file *in full*,
not just the hunks — the bug is often in how the changed lines interact with the
unchanged ones around them. If not in a git repository, ask the user what to compare.

## Step 2 — Learn the repository's rules before judging

The baseline for "correct style" is this repository, not your general taste. Before the
review passes, spend a few minutes establishing what this codebase considers normal:

- Read `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` if present — these are explicit
  house rules and violations of them outrank your own preferences.
- Check linter/formatter configs (`.editorconfig`, `eslint`/`ruff`/`.editorconfig`/
  analyzer settings) for enforced rules.
- Open 2–3 files that are *siblings* of the changed files (same directory or same layer)
  and note the established patterns: naming, error handling, layering, DI style, how
  queries are built, how tests are structured.

This matters because a public review skill knows nothing about any particular codebase —
the conventions pass (Step 3E) is only as good as the baseline you build here. It also
prevents the most annoying reviewer failure: flagging code for violating a rule the
repository doesn't actually have.

Outside strict blind mode, `.agent-review/baseline.md` may be used as a cached
convention baseline after spot-checking it against current code; see
`references/conventions.md`. Read prior run reports only when the user explicitly
requests a follow-up review. In strict blind mode, ignore the entire
`.agent-review/` directory.

## Step 3 — The five review passes

Run all five passes over the diff. Each pass has a reference file with detailed
checklists and known failure patterns — load it when the diff touches that territory
(e.g., read `references/cost.md` whenever the diff touches a database, an external API,
or telemetry). Skip a reference only when the pass is clearly irrelevant (e.g., no I/O
anywhere in the diff → skip cost).

### 3A. Regression — did this break something that used to work?

The highest-severity pass. For every changed or deleted public symbol (function, method,
endpoint, exported type, config key, DB field), find its callers and consumers with
search tools and confirm each still works. Details and checklist:
`references/regression.md`.

### 3B. Performance — does this do more work than it needs to?

Look for I/O inside loops, N+1 query patterns, sync-over-async, unbounded reads,
missing pagination, and accidental algorithmic blowups. Details:
`references/performance.md`.

### 3C. Cost — does this spend money per call, per row, or per byte?

Performance bugs waste time; cost bugs waste money silently, and they scale with
traffic. Anything metered is in scope: request-unit databases (Cosmos DB, DynamoDB),
per-call APIs (LLMs, maps, SMS), egress, log/telemetry volume, storage operations.
Details and a Cosmos DB deep-dive: `references/cost.md`.

### 3D. Readability — will the next human understand this?

Naming, function size, nesting depth, dead code, comment quality, and the
agent-specific smells (narration comments, defensive try/catch wrapping, speculative
generality). Details: `references/readability.md`.

### 3E. Conventions — does this look like it belongs in this repository?

Compare the diff against the baseline from Step 2: layering, naming, error handling,
DI, test placement. A convention violation is judged against *this repo's* rules, never
against generic best practice. Details: `references/conventions.md`. When the repo has
no precedent on a point and the diff is C#, fall back to the Microsoft baseline in
`references/csharp-conventions.md`.

## Step 4 — Verify before reporting

Before a finding goes in the report, re-check it against the code:

- For a regression claim: show the caller that breaks. If you cannot name a concrete
  caller, input, or scenario that fails, downgrade it or drop it.
- For a performance/cost claim: identify the loop, the query, or the call site and state
  what makes it expensive (e.g., "query filters on `status` but the container's
  partition key is `tenantId`, so this fans out to every partition").
- For a convention claim: name the sibling file or house rule it contradicts.

If tests exist and can be run cheaply, run the ones covering the changed files and
include the result. Mark each finding **Confirmed** (you traced the failure) or **Needs
verification** (plausible, but you could not fully trace it) — never present the second
kind as the first.

## Step 5 — Report

Write the report in the language the user is conversing in. Use this structure:

```
## Review: <short description of the change>

**Verdict**: Pass | Pass with warnings | Fail

<one-paragraph summary: what the change does and the overall assessment>

### Findings

#### [Failed] <title>             ← must be fixed before this lands: broken behavior,
                                    silent data corruption, unbounded cost growth,
                                    serious performance defect, written-rule violation
<file>:<line> — evidence, why it fails, suggested fix. (Confirmed / Needs verification)

#### [Warning] <title>            ← should be considered, does not block: readability,
                                    convention drift, missed cheap optimization
...

### Passed checks
<one line per pass that found nothing, e.g. "Cost: no metered calls in this diff — Pass">
```

Rules for the report:

- Two severities only. **Failed** = the change must not land as-is. **Warning** =
  worth fixing, but a human may reasonably accept it. Order Failed findings worst
  first (broken behavior and data corruption above cost, cost above rule violations).
- Verdict follows from the findings: any Failed → **Fail**; only Warnings →
  **Pass with warnings**; nothing → **Pass**.
- The "Passed checks" section is not filler — it tells the reader which risks were
  actually ruled out, which is half the value of a review.
- Do not pad. Three verified findings beat ten speculative ones. An empty findings list
  with a confident "checked and clean" section is a perfectly good review.
- Suggest fixes but do not apply them unless the user asks. The deliverable of this
  skill is the review.
- Persist the final report as `REVIEW.md` in the same directory as the confirmed
  spec (`SPEC.md`), including the fenced machine-readable JSON block; overwrite it on
  a re-review of the same work. The conversation report remains the source of truth.

### Machine-readable result

Make the machine-readable object conform to
`../../schemas/review-result.schema.json`. It is the contract that lets automation —
the `run-review-loop` and `apply-review-findings` skills, CI scripts — consume the
review without parsing prose.

For an interactive review, keep the prose report as the source of truth and end it
with the fenced JSON object below. When the host supplies the schema as a native
structured-output constraint, or CI explicitly requests raw JSON, return only the
schema-conforming object with no fence or surrounding prose. Never make automation
extract JSON from prose.

```json
{
  "verdict": "pass | pass_with_warnings | fail",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "failed | warning",
      "title": "same title as the prose finding",
      "file": "relative/path",
      "line": 0,
      "confidence": "confirmed | needs_verification",
      "fix_hint": "one-line suggested fix"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules: `verdict` and `findings` must match the prose exactly when prose is present
(same count, same severities, same titles). A passing review has `"findings": []`;
`pass_with_warnings` contains warnings only; `fail` contains at least one Failed
finding. If native schema validation rejects the result, correct the result instead of
loosening the schema or inferring a verdict.
