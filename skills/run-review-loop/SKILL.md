name: run-review-loop
description: Run a bounded, specification-grounded develop-review-fix loop on a repository until executable acceptance checks pass and independent code review has no failed findings. Use when the user asks to implement or repair work in a review loop, iterate until clean, run the Veriloop workflow, or invokes $run-review-loop. Requires an explicit goal, a confirmed written specification, executable acceptance checks, and scope bounds. Do not use for a one-off review or for open-ended make-it-better requests.

# Run Review Loop

Control a develop → review → fix cycle with a maximum of three iterations. The
confirmed specification owns required behavior. Existing code is evidence of current
behavior and local conventions, not authority for product intent.

## 1. Establish the goal contract

Before changing code, record:

1. Specification: a confirmed requirements/design document, ADR, detailed ticket, or
   API contract. Pass its path to every worker and reviewer.
2. Goal: one or two sentences describing the finished state.
3. Executable acceptance criteria: pair every criterion with an exact command or
   observable assertion. Capture exit codes and relevant output.
4. Scope bounds: behavior, interfaces, storage formats, and modules that must not
   change.

If the specification is missing, invoke the bundled draft-spec skill and pause the
loop until the user confirms the document. If the goal, checks, or scope bounds are
too vague, ask the smallest blocking question. Never start from a guessed contract.
An unevaluable acceptance check fails; diagnose and rerun it instead of inferring
success.

Add a runtime smoke check when the specification covers a runnable service and the
repository has a safe, inexpensive local start path.

## 2. Load optional role configuration

Read .agent-review/config.json when present. Supported roles are developer, fixer,
reviewer, and gate. inherit, a missing role, or a missing file means the current
session model.

When delegating, apply an exact configured model only if the host supports model
overrides. If the configured model cannot be used, stop and ask rather than silently
substituting another model. The user's configuration is authoritative.

Treat a missing `blind_mode` as `strict`. Strict is the only persistent mode; never
save relaxed mode as a repository default.

## 3. Define role contracts and least privilege

Keep each role to one responsibility and request only the capabilities it needs:

| Role | Allowlisted input | Required output | Capability boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| controller | full run state | run record and user report | orchestrate, run acceptance checks, write `.agent-review/`; never implement, review, or fix |
| developer | spec, goal, current batch, scope, checks | schema-valid worker result | read/write target and run required checks; no review history or gate material |
| fixer | Failed findings or minimal gate failure packet | schema-valid worker result | read/write target and run required checks; no passed probes |
| reviewer | strict-blind allowlist below | review result | read/search target and run safe checks; never write target or cause external side effects |
| gate | reviewer allowlist plus snapshot | gate result | read/search frozen target and use isolated temporary tests; never write target or fix |

Use host-enforced read/write or tool allowlists when available. Otherwise state the
same boundary in the role brief; strict blind mode still describes context isolation,
not a filesystem security claim.

Keep worker responses compact. Return changed files, check command or assertion,
result, short evidence, and blockers; omit reasoning traces and full tool transcripts.
The controller must never paste raw worker output into another role's brief.

Before delegation, create a unique artifact staging directory outside the target
worktree and grant the worker access only to its target plus that directory. Keep the
entire UTF-8 worker result at or below 16 KiB. Keep each evidence excerpt, tool error,
and blocker message at or below 512 characters. The schema also caps checks at 32,
tool failures at 16, and artifacts at 8.

When essential output does not fit, write it to the issued staging directory and
return only the short excerpt plus `artifact_path`. Declare every referenced artifact
with its byte count and SHA-256 digest; one artifact may be at most 10 MiB. Reject a
missing, oversized, digest-mismatched, undeclared, unreferenced, duplicate, symlinked,
or staging-escaping path. Do not create another agent or split one result to handle
large output.

Redact credentials, personal data, and unrelated environment details before writing
an artifact. Never preserve secret-bearing output merely because it is outside the
conversation context.

Do not read artifacts into controller context on a successful path. Inspect the
smallest relevant slice only when a check failed, the compact fields contradict each
other, or the user requests the detail. Never send artifact contents or paths to a
reviewer or gate.

### Handle worker termination and results fail-closed

Inspect the host delegation/tool status before reading the worker body. A reported
timeout, cancellation, context limit, or tool failure is authoritative; never infer
completion from a partial message or changed worktree. Record a compact synthetic
worker result with the matching termination and blocker, then exit as `worker_blocked`
or `worker_failed`.

Require every developer and fixer response to conform to
`../../schemas/worker-result.schema.json`. Use native structured output when the host
supports it. Otherwise require the entire final response to be one raw JSON object
without prose or fences, parse the whole response with a JSON parser, and validate the
schema. Never extract JSON from mixed prose with a regular expression.

For a normally returned but invalid object, allow one format-only retry in the same
worker context. Give only the schema and validation error; do not rerun tools, edit
code, or start another implementation attempt. If the retry is invalid, record a
synthetic `blocked` result with `termination: invalid_result` and exit as
`worker_result_invalid`.

Treat an oversized result as contract-invalid. The format-only retry may shorten
fields and reference an artifact already written during the original work, but it must
not run a tool, write a new artifact, repeat implementation, or delegate to another
agent. If essential evidence exists only in the oversized response, stop as
`worker_result_invalid` rather than discard it and claim completion.

If the host cannot parse and validate the whole object reliably, do not use a
best-effort textual fallback; record `invalid_result` and stop.

Apply these semantic checks after schema validation:

- `completed` requires `termination: completed`, `blocker: null`, no tool failures,
  and every required check at `pass`. A command check records its real exit code and
  cannot pass with a nonzero or missing exit code. Mark a non-command observable as
  `kind: assertion` with `exit_code: null`; never use it to hide an unevaluated command.
- A developer result must cover the named checks assigned to its current acceptance
  batch, and the controller reruns those acceptance checks on the resulting revision.
  A fixer result must contain one check whose `criterion` exactly matches each Failed
  finding title it received. Do not substitute a convenient caller check for the
  failing invariant.
- `blocked` or `failed` requires a non-null blocker and must never advance to review,
  snapshot, or gate. Preserve any already changed files for the user to inspect.
- A missing response is not an empty successful result. Map the host termination to a
  synthetic blocked/failed result instead.

The controller, not the worker, decides the run exit. Archive the validated or
synthetic object and keep full tool transcripts out of later role briefs.

## 4. Enforce strict blind mode

Before development, verify that the host can:

1. create a unique internal subagent for every iteration reviewer and final gate;
2. start each with no controller, developer, fixer, or prior-review conversation;
3. send an allowlisted brief without attaching hidden conversation history.

If any guarantee is unavailable, stop before changing code and name the unsupported
capability. Ask whether the user authorizes relaxed review **for this run only**.
Never infer approval from urgency, configuration, or a previous run. If approved, use
the strongest available separation, keep the review verdict vocabulary unchanged,
label each affected review and gate `independence: reduced` in the controller
record, and record the reason and authorization in `run.json`. If not
approved, exit with `blind_context_unavailable`. Never describe relaxed review as
independent or blind.

## 5. Maintain the findings ledger

Create .agent-review/ledger.json with {"findings": []} when absent.

Use a stable slug derived from file and finding title. Track severity, title, file,
first_seen, last_seen, and status (open, pass, recurred, or accepted). A finding that
returns after reaching pass becomes recurred.

The controller owns the ledger. Never send it to a reviewer or gate. Reconcile
accepted warnings after receiving a blind report instead of preloading them into the
reviewer's context.

## 6. Plan low-cost implementation batches

Use one development batch for a small cohesive change. When the specification divides
into independently checkable acceptance groups or components, order the smallest
coherent batches before development. Give a fresh worker only the current batch, the
necessary spec slice, global scope bounds, and that batch's checks. Complete its checks
before starting the next batch.

Do not run a blind review after every development batch; that multiplies reviewer cost
and exposes partial integration states. After all batches pass their local checks,
freeze and review the cumulative target. Keep cross-component and full-suite checks in
the final acceptance set. If no safe independent boundary exists, keep one batch rather
than inventing a split.

## 7. Iterate at most three times

### Develop

If the target diff already exists, skip development. Otherwise delegate the
implementation to a worker with the repository path, confirmed specification, goal
contract, scope bounds, and required verification. The worker must inspect and obey
the applicable AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, contributor guidance, and repository checks.

Use the host's internal subagent or delegation mechanism when available. Do not
create a user-owned task or external thread merely to simulate an internal worker.
Give the worker the specification and acceptance checks, but do not give it review
reports, the review checklist, gate plans, holdout probes, or reviewer reasoning.

Inspect the transport status and validate the worker result before reading completion
claims. Advance to cumulative acceptance and blind review only for a semantically valid
`completed` result. A blocked, failed, missing, or twice-invalid result exits through
the worker termination protocol above.

### Review in a unique blind context

Create a new reviewer subagent for this iteration. Never reuse a reviewer from an
earlier iteration or gate. Run the bundled `veriloop` skill with only:

- strict-blind invocation marker;
- repository path;
- frozen review target;
- confirmed specification;
- scope bounds;
- risk focus.

Do not send developer or fixer reasoning, prior reports, ledger contents, accepted
warnings, acceptance results, or gate probes. Tell the reviewer not to read
`.agent-review/`. If forbidden context leaks into the brief, discard that review and
start a clean reviewer; if that cannot be done, return to the strict-mode preflight.

Require the prose report and final machine-readable JSON block. The controller then
reconciles findings and filters previously accepted warnings without exposing history
to the reviewer. Require the object to validate against
`../../schemas/review-result.schema.json`; when the host supports native structured
output, supply that schema to the reviewer.

### Check stop conditions in order

1. Success candidate: every acceptance check passes and the verdict is pass or
   pass_with_warnings. Run the final gate below.
2. Iteration cap: iteration three ended without a successful gate. Stop and escalate
   with evidence.
3. No progress: any finding is recurred, or the failed count did not decrease from
   the previous iteration. Stop and ask for the specific human decision needed.

### Final blind gate with late-bound probes

When a success candidate is reached, freeze it by recording the commit plus a digest
of the working-tree diff. Any target change invalidates the gate.

Create one additional gate subagent that is new to the run and uses the configured
gate model. Give it only the same allowlisted inputs as a blind reviewer plus the
frozen snapshot identifier. Do not reveal the iteration verdict, acceptance results,
prior findings, ledger, developer explanations, or previous gate probes.

The gate must inspect the frozen implementation first and then generate holdout probes
that did not exist in the developer brief:

- For executable code, run at least two safe probes from different categories:
  boundary or invalid inputs, state-transition ordering, failure injection,
  property/metamorphic behavior, differential behavior, or test-strength/mutation
  checks.
- For documentation or non-executable configuration, run at least one independent
  observable assertion.
- At least one probe must exercise an in-spec behavior not identical to a named
  acceptance check.

Prefer non-mutating commands. If a temporary test is required, use an isolated
temporary workspace and never edit the target worktree. A probe that cannot execute
is blocked, not passed. The gate must not fix code.

The gate holds only when the snapshot is unchanged, every holdout probe passes, and no
new Failed finding exists. Its report must include the snapshot, probe category,
command or assertion, captured evidence, and any new Failed finding.

Require a final machine-readable gate block:

```json
{
  "gate": "hold | fail | blocked",
  "snapshot": "commit-and-diff identifier",
  "independence": "strict | reduced",
  "probes": [
    {
      "category": "boundary | state | failure | property | differential | mutation | assertion",
      "check": "command or observable assertion",
      "result": "pass | fail | blocked",
      "evidence": "captured output"
    }
  ],
  "findings": []
}
```

Require this object to validate against `../../schemas/gate-result.schema.json`; use
native structured output when the host supports it. A schema-invalid gate is blocked,
not held. Each gate finding contains `severity: failed`, title, relative file, line
(`0` when no single line applies), and captured evidence.

On failure, add the finding to the controller-owned ledger and give the fixer only the
failed invariant and minimal reproducible evidence; withhold passed probes and the
rest of the gate's reasoning. After fixing and blind review, create another entirely
new gate that generates new probes. Continue within the same three-iteration limit.

Warnings never keep the loop running by themselves.

### Fix

When failed findings remain, delegate the bundled apply-review-findings skill with
the review report, confirmed specification, risk focus, and ledger. Require minimal
edits and verification against each finding's evidence. Then review again in a fresh
context.

For a blind-gate failure, pass only the minimal failure packet defined above, not the
full gate report. Never let the fixer read passed holdout probes.

Validate the fixer result with the same worker protocol. Review the repaired target in
a fresh context only after a semantically valid `completed` result and passing
per-finding checks.

## 8. Archive and report

On every exit, create the next numbered .agent-review/runs/NNN/ directory. Store each
developer and fixer result as a JSON file conforming to
`../../schemas/worker-result.schema.json`, each
iteration's prose review plus JSON block, each full gate result as a JSON file that
conforms to `../../schemas/gate-result.schema.json`, and a run.json containing the
goal, spec path, per-iteration verdict/counts and review paths, acceptance results,
worker-result paths, blind mode, any authorized relaxation, gate-result paths and final
summary, and exit reason. Write archives only after the run exits so no active reviewer can consume
them. Do not copy the specification into the archive.

Copy referenced staging artifacts into that run's `artifacts/` directory, rewrite the
archived worker-result paths to those copies, and revalidate byte counts and digests.
Do not archive unreferenced files or retain the staging directory after a verified
copy. Artifact content remains excluded from reports and later role briefs.

Write `run.json` to conform to `../../schemas/run-result.schema.json`, using the exact
exit identifiers `goal_met`, `iteration_cap`, `no_progress`, and
`blind_context_unavailable`, plus `worker_blocked`, `worker_failed`, and
`worker_result_invalid` for worker termination exits. Validate it before reporting
success; an invalid archive cannot change the actual gate verdict but must be reported
as an archival failure.

Report:

- exit reason: goal met, iteration cap, no progress, blind context unavailable, worker
  blocked/failed, or invalid worker result;
- worker termination: role, status, termination, failed/blocked check, and blocker;
- every acceptance criterion, exact check, Pass/Fail, and captured evidence;
- each iteration's verdict and failed/warning counts;
- every resolved finding as Pass;
- every remaining warning and its required disposition: accept, file an issue, or
  clean up now.

Persist the final report as `REVIEW.md` in the same directory as the confirmed
specification (`SPEC.md`), so the outcome lives beside the spec it verified.

Record accepted warnings in the ledger. Do not create issues or apply warning-only
cleanup without the user's authorization. The text report remains the source of truth.
